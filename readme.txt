## Agenda Editor

This plugin tweaks the editor to support Bootstrap grid and adds a "Grid Block". 

### Source files

Source files for blocks and editor scss can be found at `src` folder in our public [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/agenda-helsinki/agenda-editor). 

WordPress hooks and built-in functionality are called in `src/init.php`. Initialization of block-related JavaScript/TypeScript is initialized in `src/blocks.tsx`. SCSS-source for front-end and editor are initialized at `src/style.scss` and `src/editor.scss` respectively.

To compile a version of your own, you need `nodejs`, `npm` installed on your operating system. `yarn` is also recommended. To start the compilation, run the following in a terminal:

```
yarn

yarn start
```

or with npm:

```
npm

npm start
```
